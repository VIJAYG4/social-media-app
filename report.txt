Common graphql errors:
1) Throws a weird incomprehendible error inside node modules.
error: "cannot return null for non-nullable object" 
Solution:
Mostly some files are not saved in vscode. Save all the files 
separately in vscode where you made changes. 

2)SECRET_KEY should have value. 
Sometimes SECRET_KEY value will not work properly. don't hardcode
any value for it as it will create user login errors 
(invalid/expired token) 
Solution:
don't hardcode any values for SECRET_KEY. if you do, you have to 
register and login a new user. the old user would have used 
the old SECRET_KEY value and will not accept the login.

3) cannot read property "find" of undefined in graphql:
solution: forgot to add "await" keyword for the operation. ex: await Post.find()
